            According to the career expectation, I have started my career in Oracle where I have built different types of ERP solutions by
            using Oracle Database and Oracle Forms & Report Builders. Which I contributed to the Confidence Software Limited. I have
            connected to a large number of clients and solutions to their problems. I also troubleshoot many more problems with SQL & PL/SQL
            and Oracle Apex. Within this time technology has changed rapidly. Market ware expects reporting service and I manage my clients
            by jasper report. In the year 2021 I drive my career within the latest technology by HTML-5,CSS-3, JavaScript, React js, Node
            js, TypeScript, MongoDB. HTML Report,Crystal Report. Now I am given support by Paramount Insurance Company Limited as Deputy
            Manager (IT). I am not close to learning technology according to market expectations. I hope it will open a new door for my
            career.
